###Simulacram
Simulacram is a simple way to pass in a dictionary object, with column names and corresponding data types and output a pandas
DataFrame of random data. This is great for creating a fake data set or testing a data science script whose validity through
generalization needs to be tested. This is still a work in Progress. right now numerical data can be made to fit a common
statistical distribution so long as the proper statistical parameters are included with the type key in the dictionary.
